# Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is Google's Backend-as-a-Service that can scale quickly to support millions of users. Originally developed as a realtime database, Firebase now helps us solve common app development challenges like authentication, storage and messaging to name a few.

With our Enterprise SSO integration, you can have your users managed as part of the Firebase user store. The Enterprise SAML or OIDC identities of your customer can then be authorised to access other services like CloudStorage.

Visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson-examples/tree/main/apps/firebase-user-store) to see the source code for the Firebase integration.
