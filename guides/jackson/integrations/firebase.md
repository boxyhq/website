# Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is Google's Backend-as-a-Service that can scale quickly to support millions of users. Originally developed as a realtime database, Firebase now helps us solve common app development challenges like authentication, storage and messaging to name a few.

With our integration, you can have your users managed as part of the Firebase user store. This way, you can open up access to other Firebase services like Cloud Storage for all the Enterprise SAML or OIDC users of your customer.

Visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson-examples/tree/main/apps/firebase-user-store) to see the source code for the Firebase integration.
