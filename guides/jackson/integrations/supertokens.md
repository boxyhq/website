# SuperTokens

[SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/) is an open core alternative to proprietary login providers like Auth0 or AWS Cognito.

SuperTokens allows you to use SAML Jackson as a custom OAuth provider.

Follow [this documentation](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/common-customizations/saml/with-boxyhq/integration-steps) to learn about how to use SAML Jackson with SuperTokens.

Visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/supertokens/jackson-supertokens-express) to see the source code for the SuperTokens SAML SSO integration. We also have a [Next.js + Supertokens + Jackson](https://github.com/nadilas/jackson-next-supertokens) integration for you to draw inspiration from.
