# Auth0

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) doesn't need any introduction, it is one of the most popular Auth products out there. After the Okta acquisition though there's been pressure on Auth0 to focus on the Enterprise segment and unfortunately this has meant that as a startup you only get three Enterprise SSO connections (SAML or OIDC) for your apps before they try and get you onto a very expensive plan.

As an early-stage startup this makes Enterprise SSO integration unaffordable, this is why we have created a seamless way to continue using Auth0 for auth but plug-in BoxyHQ for Enterprise SSO directly from Auth0. Your user management stays entirely in Auth0 but using BoxyHQ's OAuth 2.0 skin you can make Enterprise SAML or OIDC logins available to your customers.

Visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson-examples/tree/main/apps/auth0-user-store) to see the source code for the Auth0 integration.
