          Building your own SAML or OpenID Connect integration for each IdP can
          be very resource heavy and take a long time. You will end up building
          a custom integration for each IdP your customers use and this could
          take months!
        </p>
        <p>
          With our SSO solution you can go from the first line of code to
          deploying in production in days instead of weeks! We also provide you
          with custom integration support along the way so you have help each
          step of the way.

        <p>
          Most enterprises already use an IdP and will prefer solution providers
          who have a Enterprise SSO integration. This is because they already
          use SAML or OpenID Connect for access management and security so
          anything outside this workflow will be a hassle for them.
