          Creating a custom SAML or OpenID Connect integration for each IdP can
          be very time-consuming and require a significant amount of resources.
          This can lead to months of development time spent building custom
          integrations for each IdP your customers use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our SSO solution allows you to go from the first line of code to
          deployment in just a few days, saving you time and effort. Plus, we
          offer custom integration support to help you every step of the way.{' '}

          Most enterprises already use an IdP, so they prefer solution providers
          with an Enterprise SSO integration. This is because they are already
          using SAML or OpenID Connect for access management and security, so
          anything outside of this workflow will be inconvenient for them.
