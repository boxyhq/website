            allows enterprises to swiftly roll out new software products with

          <Picture
            alt="The image shows an identity federation flow managed by BoxyHQ. Internal apps like CRM and data tools connect to an Identity Provider using OIDC/SAML 2.0. The Identity Provider then connects to a Service Provider, which interfaces with external identity providers like Okta, SAML IdP, and Entra ID. Key features include custom mappings, reduced IT configuration, and zero code changes."
