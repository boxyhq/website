          cases where it is specifically indicated that it is data required for

        </p>
        <p>
          The user declares and guarantees that all the data provided by him are
          true and correct and undertakes to keep them updated. The changes may

        </p>

        <h2>Purpose &mdash; What do we use personal data for?</h2>
        <p>
          The personal data requested to the user will be used for the following
          purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To provide our Service and fulfill your requests. We use your
            information to provide and maintain our Service, to process and
            fulfill your requests, to communicate with you about your use of our
            Service or changes to our Service, to respond to your inquiries, and
            for other customer service and business administration purposes. For
            example, when you enroll in a newsletter, we may use your personal
            information to deliver that newsletter to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification and authentication purposes. We may use your
            information for identification and authentication purposes. For
            example, when you enter your account login ID and password to enter
            one of our registration or login portals, we use your login
            credentials to authenticate your identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personalization. We use your information to tailor the content and
            information that we may send or display to you, to offer location
            customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to
            otherwise personalize your experience while using the Service. For
            example, if you allow us to collection geolocation data, we use this
            information to deliver content that is around your specific location
            and identify business location/listings around your location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Marketing and promotional purposes. We may use your information to
            send you news and newsletters, event updates, and to communicate
            with you about new features, offers, events, or products, or to
            otherwise contact you about information we think may be of interest
            to you. We may also use your information to display advertisements
            to you on our site (including to sell advertising space on the
            Service) and on other unaffiliated websites and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Research and reporting. We may use your information to administer
            surveys and questionnaires (online and offline) for research and
            reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning
            more about their needs and the quality of the products, services,
            and educational information we provide. The survey responses may be
            utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Service, various
            types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional
            activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combining information. We (and our third party business partners on
            our behalf) may merge, co-mingle, or otherwise combine information,
            including your personal information, in furtherance of the purposes
            described above.
          </li>
          <li>
            To comply with legal obligations. We may use your information to
            comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our
            rights or the rights of a third party, including complying with law
            enforcement or government authority requests and participating in
            compliance audits.
          </li>
          <li>
            To protect us and others. We may use your information where we
            believe it necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
            regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, fraud, situations
            involving potential threats to the safety of any person or to
            otherwise enforce this Policy, our Terms and Conditions, and the
            integrity of the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deidentified data. We may also deidentify or anonymize your data in
            such a way that you may not reasonably be re-identified by us or
            another party, and we may use this deidentified data for any purpose
            permitted under applicable law. To the extent we deidentify any data
            originally based on personal information, we will maintain and use
            such data in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify
            the data.

          The data subject to treatment will not be used for purposes other than
          or incompatible with those mentioned above and that motivated its
          collection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is stated that the
          recorded data may be used, in addition to the purposes for which it
          was expressly collected, for the purpose of carrying out statistics,
          managing incidents or conducting market studies. However, in the event
          that personal data is processed for a purpose other than that
          initially specified when collecting said data, a compatibility
          analysis will be carried out by BoxyHQ Inc. in accordance with
          applicable regulations. The processing will only be authorized if the
          original purpose is compatible with the new purpose or allowed in
          accordance with an independent legal basis. In these cases, the user
          will be informed of the changes in purpose or legal justification for
          the processing of their data.

          Your personal information will be held for only so long as it is

          for the shortest possible period permissible under applicable law. To
          determine the appropriate retention period for personal information,
          we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal
          information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or

          business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price

            the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service
            difference; and
          </li>
          <li>
            a description of the method the business used to calculate the value
