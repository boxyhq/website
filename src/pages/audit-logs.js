          With our open-source solution, you can deploy SAML SSO with a
          straightforward integration that connects to all IdPs. You simply
          integrate with SAML Jackson and then we provide you with integration
          for all the IdPs.

        <p>
          Building your own SAML integration for each IdP can be very resource
          heavy and take a long time. You will end up building a custom
          integration for each IdP your customers use and this could take
          months!
        </p>
        <p>
          With SAML Jackson you can go from the first line of code to deploying
          in production in as little as 8 days! We also provide you with custom
          integration support along the way so you have help each step of the
          way.

          Most enterprises already use an IdP and will prefer solution providers
          who have a SAML SSO integration. This is because they already use SAML
          for access management and security so anything outside this workflow
          will be a hassle for them.
