        At BoxyHQ, we offer the flexibility to choose how you deploy our
        solutions. While our SaaS offering provides convenience and ease of use,
        we also understand the unique needs of businesses that prefer greater
        control. Thanks to our open-source core, you have the option to
        self-host our products. This allows for tailored security, compliance,
        and integration with your existing systems, giving you the best of both
        worlds â€“ our advanced technology and your customized hosting
        environment.
