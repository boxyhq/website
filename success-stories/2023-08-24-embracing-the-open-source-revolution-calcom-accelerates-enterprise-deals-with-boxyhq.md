Clients were increasingly seeking the convenience and security offered by SSO to streamline user access across multiple systems and services.

## Selecting BoxyHQ (Jackson) for Single Sign-On Integration

Cal.com's dedication to open source led them to choose BoxyHQ (Jackson) for their SSO implementation.
