## The Driving Force Behind Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)

Supademo's decision to implement enterprise SSO stemmed from the growing demand of larger customers.

While SSO wasn't a deal-breaker, Supademo aimed to ensure a seamless experience for its customers, aligning with their preferred workflow.

## Why Supademo Opted for BoxyHQ’s Jackson

Choosing the right SSO solution was crucial, and Supademo found BoxyHQ's Jackson to be a stellar choice. The decision was influenced by BoxyHQ's strong reputation and recommendations from existing Supademo customers. Prominent companies like Cal.com had successfully leveraged Jackson for their SSO needs. However, it was BoxyHQ's responsiveness and hands-on support that truly set them apart.
