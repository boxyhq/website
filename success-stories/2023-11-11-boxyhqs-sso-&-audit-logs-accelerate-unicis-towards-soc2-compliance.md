## Motivation for Implementing Enterprise SSO and Audit Logs

Unicis.Tech's motivation to implement Enterprise SSO and Audit Logs was driven by their commitment to enhancing security and compliance for their platform. These two key components play a crucial role in achieving these goals.

Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies user access by eliminating the need for users to repeatedly enter their credentials for different applications. This not only enhances convenience but also reduces the risk of phishing attacks and password fatigue.

Audit Logs track all user activity within an application, including login attempts, file access, and configuration changes. This data serves as a valuable resource for investigating security incidents, resolving issues, and complying with regulatory requirements.

Not to mention, Unicis.Tech is subject to various global regulations, including GDPR, ISO/IEC, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2. SSO and audit logs are essential for meeting these regulatory requirements, ensuring their platform remains compliant.
