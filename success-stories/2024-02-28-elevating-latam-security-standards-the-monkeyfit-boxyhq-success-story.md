## Solutions and Benefits: A Dual-Benefit Approach

The adoption of BoxyHQ’s SSO solution brought about both direct and soft benefits. Directly, it simplified the integration process with identity providers, reducing development time significantly—by an estimated five sprints. This efficiency gain was not merely a measure of time saved but also a testament to the enriched knowledge base and accelerated development framework MonkeyFit now enjoys.
Soft benefits, often overlooked, were equally transformative. The solution's Dockerized nature ensured zero downtime for critical functionalities like sign-in and signup processes. Moreover, by serving as middleware between identity providers, it extended support to both SAML and OIDC protocols, broadening MonkeyFit's appeal to a wider array of future clients.

## A Quote from the Front Lines

Reflecting on the journey, a MonkeyFit spokesperson highlighted the transformative impact of BoxyHQ’s solution: "During development, SAML Jackson provided a well-documented and clear flow for making calls to the tool, reducing time in spikes and R&D compared to a direct integration with identity providers."
