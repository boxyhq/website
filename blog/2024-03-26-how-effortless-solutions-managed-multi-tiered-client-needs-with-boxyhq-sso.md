Efficiency and security are critical when implementing high-impact solutions leaving Effortless Solutions with a unique challenge: implementing an Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) solution to meet the needs of a client's client in the Netherlands. The requirement was for a SaaS application developed on the Bubble platform to integrate seamlessly with Microsoft EntraID, all while ensuring little to no disruption and downtime. This emphasized the need for a streamlined implementation process that would enhance productivity while maintaining high-security standards.

The search for a suitable SSO solution led Effortless Solutions to select BoxyHQ. This decision was driven by several factors: positive customer feedback, the open-source nature of BoxyHQ which mitigated vendor lock-in concerns, and seamless integration with Bubble.

## What was the motivation to implement Enterprise SSO?

**Ahmed Elkaffas (Effortless Solutions):** The motivation to implement [enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)](/enterprise-sso) came from a specific requirement of one of our customer's clients in the Netherlands. This client, using the software as a service (SaaS) application developed on the Bubble platform, wanted their application to seamlessly integrate with their existing Microsoft EntraID infrastructure.

They aimed to create a seamless, efficient login process for employees, eliminating the need for multiple logins and thereby increasing productivity and ensuring a higher level of security compliance. This need for a streamlined authentication process that could integrate well with the customer's existing systems and protocols was the main driving force behind seeking an enterprise SSO solution, leading to the selection and implementation of BoxyHQ.

## What factors led you to select BoxyHQ (SAML Jackson) for this implementation?

**Ahmed (Effortless Solutions):** We selected BoxyHQ for the implementation of our enterprise SSO solution due to several critical factors that aligned with our needs and values:

- **Positive Customer Feedback**: Initial research and feedback from existing BoxyHQ customers highlighted the product's effectiveness and reliability, giving us confidence in its potential to meet our requirements.
- **Open Source and Avoiding Vendor Lock-In**: BoxyHQ's open-source nature was a significant factor in our selection process. It meant that we could implement the solution without worrying about vendor lock-in, granting us and our customer the freedom to switch solutions or self-host if needed, thus ensuring long-term flexibility.
- **Seamless Integration with Bubble**: BoxyHQ offered a seamless integration with Bubble, which was essential for us. We sought an SSO solution that could be integrated without the hassle of developing or adopting new plugins, as this ran the risk of disrupting operations or delaying deployment.
- **Rapid Deployment and Comprehensive Security Compliance**: The ease of adoption of BoxyHQ, combined with its compliance with stringent security standards, was crucial, particularly in the European context where security compliance is not optional but mandatory.

These factors collectively contributed to the decision to implement BoxyHQ as our chosen enterprise SSO solution, addressing the specific needs of our customer and their end-users while aligning with their broader security, flexibility, and integration requirements.
