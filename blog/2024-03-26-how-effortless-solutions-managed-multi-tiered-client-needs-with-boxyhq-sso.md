Effortless Solutions faced a unique challenge: implementing an Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for a customer's client in the Netherlands, requiring a SaaS application developed on the Bubble platform to seamlessly integrate with Microsoft EntraID, ensuring minimal disruption and downtime while enhancing productivity and maintaining high-security standards. After careful consideration, Effortless Solutions selected BoxyHQ due to positive customer feedback, its open-source nature mitigating vendor lock-in concerns, and seamless integration with Bubble.

## What was the motivation to implement Enterprise SSO?

**Ahmed Elkaffas (Effortless Solutions):** The motivation to implement [enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)](/enterprise-sso) came from a specific requirement of one of our customer's clients in the Netherlands. This client, using a software as a service (SaaS) application developed on the Bubble platform, wanted their application to seamlessly integrate with their existing Microsoft EntraID infrastructure.

They aimed to create a seamless, efficient login process for employees, eliminating the need for multiple logins and thereby increasing productivity and ensuring a higher level of security compliance. This need for a streamlined authentication process that could integrate well with the customer's existing systems and protocols was the main driving force behind seeking an enterprise SSO solution, leading to the selection and implementation of BoxyHQ SaaS.

## What factors led you to select BoxyHQ (SAML Jackson) for this implementation?

**Ahmed (Effortless Solutions):** We selected BoxyHQ for the implementation of our enterprise SSO solution due to several critical factors that aligned with our needs and values:

- **Positive Customer Feedback**: Initial research and feedback from existing BoxyHQ customers highlighted the product's effectiveness and reliability, giving us confidence in its potential to meet our requirements.
- **Open Source and Avoiding Vendor Lock-In**: BoxyHQ's open-source nature was a significant factor in our selection process. It meant that we could implement the solution without worrying about vendor lock-in, granting us and our customer the freedom to switch solutions or self-host if needed, thus ensuring long-term flexibility.
- **Seamless Integration with Bubble**: BoxyHQ offered a seamless integration with Bubble, which was essential for us. We sought an SSO solution that could be integrated without the hassle of developing or adopting new plugins, as this ran the risk of disrupting operations or delaying deployment.
- **Rapid Deployment and Comprehensive Security Compliance**: The ease of adoption of BoxyHQ, combined with its compliance with stringent security standards, was crucial, particularly in the European context where security compliance is not optional but mandatory.

These factors collectively contributed to the decision to implement BoxyHQ as our chosen enterprise SSO solution, addressing the specific needs of our customer and their end-users while aligning with their broader security, flexibility, and integration requirements.

## In terms of business impact, how much time did it save Effortless Solutions?

**Ahmed (Effortless Solutions):** We experienced significant time savings by choosing BoxyHQ for our enterprise SSO implementation. The expectation that the solution could be deployed within a matter of days was a key advantage over other potential solutions that might have taken months to implement. This was then also our experience during implementation. Not only did the production deployment go smoothly, but it was completed in days with no disruption to any of the client's end users.

 We encountered a problem during testing on the development environment which we reported to BoxyHQ on Friday afternoon. On Monday, BoxyHQ had fixed and deployed a new version ready for us to test. We tested it, and it worked fantastically.

## Have you seen any significant growth in acquiring enterprise clients as a direct result of utilizing SSO?

**Ahmed (Effortless Solutions):** Now that we have successfully deployed BoxyHQ for one of our clients, we can approach future clients with confidence knowing that we can rely on the support of BoxyHQ and that we can guarantee an implementation timeline of days instead of weeks or months. This changes everything for us and opens new doors for Effortless Solutions.

We wish to thank everyone at BoxyHQ for their dedication to the success of our implementation and for being a partner in our success.
