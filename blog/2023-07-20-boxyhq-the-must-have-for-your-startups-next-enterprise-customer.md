## Introduction

BoxyHQ enables you to add plug-and-play enterprise-ready features to your SaaS product.

## The Why

It initially started with identifying the pain of developers having a TON of responsibility — right from infrastructure to actually building the product.

And with the growing cybersecurity attacks, they need to start thinking about security as well.

[Cyber-crimes are predicted to cost $10.5 trillion annually by 2025]

The goal is to help smaller startups become <b>enterprise-ready.</b>

Because until there’s an enterprise client coming in, security is usually an <i>afterthought.</i>

But they (enterprise customers) are the ones who question your security posture, compliances and more — as a company.

[About 70% of development teams skip crucial security steps due to time pressures.]

That’s where BoxyHQ comes in.

#### <i>But wait… What is enterprise-readiness?</i>

![Question](/img/blog/scoutflo/blog-question.png)

In a nutshell, it’s being secure, scalable, stable, and easy to run in production.

According to <b>Sama — Carlos Samame (Co-Founder)</b>, there are 2 paths for startups towards the need to be enterprise-ready:

1. Initially focused on smaller customers and now looking to expand.

   OR

2. Building a new product and targeting enterprise customers from Day 1.

<i>But how do things look like from the enterprises’ end?</i>

Enterprise customers are often apprehensive (concerned) about trusting startups vs. established businesses. Because the stakes are usually much higher.

#### They’re mainly looking for 2 things

1. Your other enterprise customers (helps credibility)

2. Whether you follow the compliance requirements (key necessity)

They look for quite a few standards to be met in a solution provider 👇🏻

Before you feel overwhelmed, he further adds that you don’t need to start building all of this, and focus on 3 key areas:

1. #### Customer obsession

   Understand their current needs, pains, motivations, processes, and most importantly — whether the plenty of software they already use will work smoothly with yours.

2. #### Time to market

   Invest in off-the-shelf enterprise readiness solutions that you can integrate into your SaaS app vs. spending months building in-house. Spend more time on your core product vs. non-core features.

3. #### Reduced engineering costs

   Investing in external solutions saves developer time spent on coding, fixing bugs, and the overall learning curve.

<i>“People’s time is more expensive than developer tools.”</i>

A great way is to rely on open easily available open source solutions.

## The BoxyHQ suite — in the chronological order of release

### 1. Open Source SAML Jackson

![Admin Portal](/img/blog/scoutflo/blog-admin-portal.jpeg)

Yep, that’s the product’s name. Pulp Fiction fans get the reference but for others–

💡 <i>Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Samuel Jackson starred in a leading role.</i>

SAML SSO was the first product created by Team BoxyHQ — pioneering their vision for enterprise readiness. (Launched on August 4, 2022)

SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language
SSO: Single Sign-on

#### What does it do?

It offers an out-of-the-box solution for deploying SAML quickly and efficiently — helping your \*enterprise customers manage access controls on their systems.

#### How does it work?

Just connect your product to BoxyHQ and everything else is managed for you!

BoxyHQ connects to almost every identity providers for you to go from the first line of code to fully support SAML in just a week!

### What are its benefits?

![Admin Portal](/img/blog/scoutflo/blog-admin-portal2.jpeg)

#### Centralized management and increased security 🔒

Enable your customers to manage access control on their own systems so they can:

- Have the right access
- Prevent password sharing
- Easily grant and revoke access as needed

#### Better user experience ✨

Just need to log in once to access all the external services on a dashboard with a single click. It’s simple and easy to use.

- Saves users’ time
- Improves your product’s UX

#### Reduces cost​s💲

All the account information is maintained and managed by the IdP vs. multiple services. This helps in saving costs.

(IdP is the identity provider — the single point that let its users access all the services from it)

<i>“The idea behind SAML SSO is that by centralizing your access to an external system you can better manage access and permission as well as improve security.”</i>

- <i>Aswin Venugopal, Senior Software Engineer</i>

### TL;DR

#### Without BoxyHQ’s SAML SSO, on the user side 😔

### 2. Open Source Directory Sync

![Directory Sync Connection](/img/blog/scoutflo/blog-ds-connection.webp)

Organizations use directories from different providers to manage user access to organization resources.

BoxyHQ’s Directory Sync lets orgs activate and deactivate user accounts, create groups, and keep their app in sync with the user directory in real time.

💡 <i>In an enterprise customer context, a directory is a central repository that holds information about employees, customers, and other resources in a company.</i>

#### In simple words, you enable your customers to

- Have higher security standards
- Centrally manage their user’s access lifecycle

It supports the SCIM 2.0 protocol

SCIM: System for Cross-domain Identity Management

<i>“Directory Sync streamlines the user lifecycle management process by saving valuable organizational hours, creating a single truth source of the user identity data, and facilitating them to keep the data secure.”</i>

-<i>BoxyHQ Official Docs</i>

### 3. Open Source Audit Logs

![Open Source Audit Logs](/img/blog/scoutflo/blog-audit-logs.webp)

BoxyHQ’s Audit Logs ‘Retraced’ offer your enterprise customers the ability to record and search events that happen on your application.

Note: Retraced was initially built by Replicated and has been enhanced by BoxyHQ.

They provide a detailed record of user actions, and can be used to monitor potential security breaches, compliance violations, and other issues.

<i>“The world’s best SaaS companies offer detailed Audit Logs, your SaaS should too as you move into serving the enterprise segment.”</i> -<i>Vanshika Srivastava</i>

#### Why are Audit Logs important?

![Open Source Audit Logs2](/img/blog/scoutflo/blog-audit-logs2.jpeg)

For most companies, the ability to monitor the flow of data and be alerted to any breaches is super essential.

Audit logs help to pinpoint any misuse of information and ensure that data policies are followed ✅

This one simple API helps you become compliant fast, and ensure your customers get all the functionality and safety they need.

### 4. Admin Portal
