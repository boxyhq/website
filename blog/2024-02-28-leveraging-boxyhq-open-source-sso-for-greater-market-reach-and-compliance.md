In the ever-evolving tech landscape, companies face myriad challenges in scaling, security, and compliance.

## Can you elaborate on both the direct benefits and second-order benefits you observed following the adoption of the solution?

**José (Pepo) (MonkeyFit):** During development, [SAML Jackson](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson) provided a well-documented and clear flow for making calls to the tool, reducing time in spikes and R&D compared to a direct integration with identity providers. Currently, SAML Jackson allows us to focus on maintaining and improving our code, leaving behind the maintenance of integration with identity providers. Thanks to SAML Jackson being Dockerized, we don't face downtime issues in critical functionality of the platform, such as sign-in and signup. Due to the use of SAML Jackson as middleware between identity providers, we now support both SAML and OIDC, opening the door for future clients.

## In terms of business impact, how much time did it save your team?

**José (Pepo) (MonkeyFit):** We calculated savings of at least 5 sprints, but in reality, the most valuable aspect, besides time, was the knowledge gained; the framework significantly accelerates development.

## Did incorporating BoxyHQ assist in accelerating your journey toward achieving SOC 2 compliance?

**José (Pepo) (MonkeyFit):** We are on the path and it definitely helps.

## Have you seen any significant growth in acquiring enterprise clients as a direct result of utilizing SSO?

**José (Pepo) (MonkeyFit):** Yes! Mainly in industries more conscious of information security practices. It is very well-received.
