In the fast-evolving realm of software development, security isn't just an option; it's the foundation on which trust and innovation thrive. At BoxyHQ, we believe that a proactive approach to security should be at the heart of every developer's journey. That's precisely why we decided to build Security Building Blocks for Developers and why we've also embarked on organizing the inaugural Developer-First Security Week – a transformative event designed to ignite a new era of secure and resilient coding practices.

## Why we are organizing The Developer-First Security Week?

In today's dynamic tech landscape, the imperative for a Developer-First Security Week is crystal clear to us. As software development continues to evolve at a rapid pace, so do the threats that target it. This dedicated week-long event brings together developers and security experts, fostering a crucial dialogue on seamlessly integrating robust security measures into the very fabric of code creation.

By prioritizing security from the start, we empower developers not only to innovate but also safeguard their creations against emerging cyber risks. The Developer-First Security Week serves as a vital platform for unveiling the strategies, trends, and best practices that shape the future of secure software development.

## How We Are Doing It?

The Developer-First Security Week isn't just another conference; it's a week-long immersion into the world of secure coding. Our "How" focuses on bringing together leading minds, practitioners, and pioneers in the field of cybersecurity and development to share insights, strategies, and real-world experiences.

This event is designed to be completely free and virtual, allowing us to reach and support as many developers and organizations as possible, ensuring that the knowledge and best practices for developer-first security are accessible to all.
