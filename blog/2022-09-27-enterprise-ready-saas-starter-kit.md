Check out the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxbEHmhTYQo) that walks through setting up your local environment and running enterprise-ready features the SaaS kit offers.

## SAML SSO

SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. It is an XML-based open standard for transferring identity data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).

[Single Sign On (SSO)](/blog/understanding-saml-sso-the-basics-from-the-solution-providers-side) allows your customers to manage their team's users outside your built-in user table.

SAML SSO is integrated with the help of [SAML Jackson](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson)

## Directory Sync (SCIM)

[Directory sync](/blog/understanding-scim-and-directory-sync) helps organizations automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of their users.

As a result, it streamlines the user lifecycle management process by saving valuable organizational hours, creating a single truth source of the user identity data, and facilitating them to keep the data secure.

## Audit Logs

Provide enterprise customers with the ability to record and search events that happen within your application. With our simple integration, you can become compliant fast and save your team from building complex solutions from scratch. 

Organizations gain the ability to monitor the flow of data and be alerted to any breaches. Audit logs help to pinpoint any misuse of information and ensure that data policies are followed.

## Webhooks & Events

Webhooks are a way for systems to notify external applications that a specific event has occurred in your SaaS app without receiving a request.

Webhooks are a great solution if the client does not know when an event will occur and wants to be notified in real-time.

Webhook is integrated with the help of [Svix](https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks)

## Team Management

Teams describe the functionality that enables modern software to be coordinated and managed.

Through Teams, SaaS app users invite others to collaboratively use the application with them by creating an account.
