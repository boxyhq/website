Ever since it was first [launched](https://remix.run/blog/remix-v1), "remix" has made a mark of its own as an edge-first web framework that moves the bulk of the JavaScript workload from the user's browser to a server closer to the user. In doing so, it embraces platform features like [Web Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and augments the good old HTML forms to support data mutations. The result is a super-fast user experience, all the while shipping less code to the browser. And we thought it would be really cool ðŸ˜Ž to plug SAML auth into a remix app. Let's get started ðŸš€. If you wish to dive straight into the source - see https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson-remix-auth

# Let's create the app first

Run `create-remix`. For this blog, you can go with the Remix App Server as the deployment target. Feel free to go with either Typescript or Javascript. All the code samples in this tutorial are written in typescript (we really love typescript)

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```
