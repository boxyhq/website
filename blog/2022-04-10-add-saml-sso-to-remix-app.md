Ever since it was first [launched](https://remix.run/blog/remix-v1), remix has made a mark of its own as an edge-first web framework which moves bulk of the JavaScript workload from the user's browser to a server closer to the user. In doing so it embraces platform features like [Web Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and augments the good old HTML forms to support data mutations. The end result is a super fast user experience all the while shipping less code to the browser. And we thought it would be a cool idea ðŸ˜Ž to plug SAML auth into a remix app. Let's get started ðŸš€.
