# SAML Jackson

SAML/OIDC Single Sign-On (SSO) service [SSO in a box from BoxyHQ]

Jackson takes a multi-tenanted approach to implementing SSO, abstracting away all the complexities of the underlying SAML/OIDC protocol. What this means is you can enable SSO for all your customers and across products from a single instance of jackson, and works with both SAML and OIDC Identity Provider(IdP)s.
