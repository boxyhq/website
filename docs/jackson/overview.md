# SAML Jackson

SAML/OIDC Single Sign-On (SSO) service [SSO in a box from BoxyHQ]. Check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson).

## Architecture

Jackson takes a multi-tenanted approach to implementing SSO, abstracting away all the complexities of the underlying SAML/OIDC protocol. What this means is you can enable SSO for all (your) customers across products from a single instance of jackson, and works with both SAML and OIDC Identity Provider(IdP)s.

Consider this scenario for a customer `acme.com` who is using two of your SaaS offerings. For now let's call them `CRM (Customer Relationship Management)` and `HRM (Human Resource Management)`. `CRM` happens to integrate with the customer (of acme.com) facing SAML Identity Provider (Azure AD), while `HRM` happens to integrate with the Google workspace account of `acme.com` employees. Let's see how SSO works in this case.

#### Configure the SSO Connection

First as the application developer, you'll need to [add](./sso-flow.md#21-add-connection) the CRM IdP connection for SAML and OIDC. This will be saved (marked as SAML Metadata and OIDC Metadata in the below diagram) within Jackson and later used to orchestrate the IdP login.

#### Login flow

Jackson uses the Authorization Code flow as outlined by the numbered steps below.

1. The Client (Browser app) initiates the login by redirecting to Jackson [`authorize`](./sso-flow.md#31-authorize) endpoint. Jackson will parse the tenant/product in the request and use it to redirect the user to the configured IdP.
2. Step 2 varies based on the Identity Provider type. For SAML IdP, Jackson would construct the SAML request, sign it and send it to IdP. The IdP validates the request and redirects the user to the login screen. For OIDC IdP, Jackson constructs an OpenId Connect request and redirects the user to the OIDC Provider authorization endpoint.
3. Once the user is logged in successfully, the IdP redirects back to Jackson. For SAML, the response contains the user profile while in the case of OIDC, the response contains the authorization code that is then used in the HTTPS request from Jackson to obtain token and userprofile. The parsed user profile is stored against a code generated by Jackson.
4. The authorization code generated by Jackson is sent back to the client app.
5. The code is exchanged for token and finally the token is used to query the userInfo endpoint to get the complete user profile.
