# Enterprise SSO

Jackson is our Single Sign-On (SSO) service for SAML/OIDC Identity Providers [SSO in a box from BoxyHQ].

Jackson implements SSO as an OAuth 2.0 flow, abstracting away all the complexities of the underlying SAML/OIDC protocol. Check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson).

## Architecture

We have developed Jackson from scratch adopting a modular architecture as shown below. The business logic is separated into controllers which helps us in incremental adoption of features.
