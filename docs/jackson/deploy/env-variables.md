# Environment Variables

The env vars are only applicable to the Jackson service. If you are using the npm then look for the options below when initializing the library.

## General configuration

### **HOST_URL**

The URL to bind to.
Default: `localhost`

### **HOST_PORT**

The port to bind to.
Default: `5225`

### **EXTERNAL_URL**

The public URL to reach this service, need for constructing for the SAML request internally.

Default: `http://{HOST_URL}:{HOST_PORT}`
NPM library option: `externalUrl`

### **JACKSON_API_KEYS**

A comma separated list of API keys that will be validated when serving the Config API requests at `/api/v1/saml/config/`.

For example `JACKSON_API_KEYS=key1,key2,key3`

### **SAML_AUDIENCE**

This is just an identifier to validate the SAML audience, this value will also get configured in the SAML apps created by your customers. Once set do not change this value unless you get your customers to reconfigure their SAML again. It is case-sensitive. This does not have to be a real URL.

Default: `https://saml.boxyhq.com`
NPM library option: `samlAudience`

### **CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER**

When `tenant` and `product` are used for the SAML flow (and PKCE is not being used) then we use `dummy` as placeholders for `client_id` and `client_secret`. This is not a security issue because SAML is tenanted and hence your Identity Provider will block access to anyone trying to log into your SAML tenant. However for additional security you should set `CLIENT_SECRET_VERIFIER` to a random secret and use that value as the `client_secret` during the OAuth 2.0 flow.

Default: `dummy`
NPM library option: `clientSecretVerifier`

### **IDP_ENABLED**

Set to true to enable IdP initiated login for SAML. SP initiated login is the only recommended flow but you might have to support IdP login at times.

Default: `false`
NPM library option: `idpEnabled`

## Database configuration

### **DB_ENGINE**

Supported values are `redis`, `sql`, `mongo`, `mem`

Default: `sql`
NPM library option: `db.engine`

### **DB_URL**

The database URL to connect to.

Example: `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`

NPM library option: `db.url`

### **DB_TYPE**

Only needed when DB_ENGINE is sql. Supported values are `postgres`, `mysql`, `mariadb`

Default: `postgres`
NPM library option: `db.type`

### **DB_TTL**

TTL for the code, session and token stores (in seconds)

Default: `300`
NPM library option: `db.ttl`

### **DB_CLEANUP_LIMIT**

Limit cleanup of TTL entries to this number

Default: `1000`
NPM library option: `db.cleanupLimit`

### **DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY**

To encrypt data at rest specify a 32 character key

You can use openssl to generate a random 32 character key:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 24
```

NPM library option: `db.encryptionKey`

### **PGSSLMODE**

If you use Heroku to deploy Postgres (or use self-signed certs for Postgres) then set this to `no-verify`. See [Heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/connecting-heroku-postgres#connecting-in-node-js) for more details

## Pre-loaded Configuration

### **PRE_LOADED_CONFIG**

If you only need a single tenant or a handful of pre-configured tenants then this config will help you read and load SAML configs. It works well with the mem DB engine so you don't have to configure any external databases for this to work (though it works with those as well). This is a path (absolute or relative) to a directory that contains files organized in the format described in the next section. Check [this section](./pre-loaded-configuration.md) for more details

NPM library option: `preLoadedConfig`

## Opentelemetry configuration

Jackson supports observability via OpenTelemetry. The following env vars are available for configuration (along with the rest of the [supported ones](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md))

### **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT**

Target URL to which the exporter is going to send metrics.

Example: `https://ingest.lightstep.com:443/metrics/otlp/v0.6`

### **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS**

Headers relevant for the endpoint, useful for specifying authentication details for providers.

Example: `lightstep-access-token=<token>,...`
