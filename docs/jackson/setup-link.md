# Setup Link (Enterprise SSO)

The Setup link is used to create a shareable link that can be used to create an SSO Connection without exposing any sensitive information.
Let's go through the steps to create a new Setup link

## Create Setup Link

You can create a new Setup link for SSO from the Connections page using `New Setup Link` button

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/connections-page.png" />

Another way is to go to the `Setup Links` section under `Enterprise SSO` menu and Click on Create New/New Setup Link button

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/setup-link-list-empty.png" />

The create Setup Link for SSO page looks like below

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/create-setup-link-page.png" />

Once the link is created you can see the the link info section at the bottom

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-created.png" />

You can copy the link by clicking on the `Copy` button

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-copied.png" />

### Regenerate Link

You can regenerate the link by clicking on `Regenerate` button

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-regenerate.png" />

Once you confirm Regenerate action you will see the new setup link in the link info section

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-regenerated.png" />

### You can go to the `Setup Links` section under `Enterprise SSO` menu and you will see the newly created link there. You can perform `ACTIONS` like `Copy`, `View`, `Regenerate` & `Delete` from this page

Regenerate

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-regenerate-from-list.png" />

Delete

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-delete.png" />

### When you open the setup link you will be landed on SSO Connection create section as there are no connections to show

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/setup-link-sso-setup.png" />

### You can create SSO Connection by filling the correct details

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/setup-link-sso-oidc.png" />

### Once you create a connection it will show up in the list and you can edit the details

<img class="mask-img" src="/images/product_images/setup-link/sso/link-copied-from-list.png" />

As you can see that setup link makes it super easy & safe to create SSO Connections.
