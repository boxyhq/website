# Setup Link

Admin portal can be used to create setup links for

- [Enterprise SSO](./jackson)
- [Directory-Sync](./directory-sync)

Setup links can be shared with anyone to let them set up connections for the products.
These links come in handy for admins to facilitate setup by non-admin users without revealing any sensitive information or giving admin access unnecessarily.
