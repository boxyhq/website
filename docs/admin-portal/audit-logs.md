# Admin Portal

Retraced can be accessed using Admin interface that allows you to manage Projects & Environments via UI. To enable the Admin Portal, make sure you deploy [Retraced with Docker Compose](../retraced/self-host/docker.md)

You can open the Admin Portal on port `5225`.

## Sign into Admin Portal

We use [Magic Links](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email) to authenticate users to the UI.

You'll need to set the following configuration in the [environment](../jackson/deploy/env-variables.md#admin-ui-configuration):

1. SMTP Server details, so we can send you the email with the magic link.
2. Access Control List which is an array of emails or glob patterns. Only these users will be allowed access to the Admin Portal. Example: `tonystark@gmail.com,*@marvel.com`.

Follow the below steps to login into the Admin dashboard.

- Visit the path `/api/auth/signin` on your app. The page will display a sign-in page with a text box to enter the email address.
- Enter the email address that matches the `NEXTAUTH_ACL` and click the button **Sign in with Email**.
- Open the inbox and you'll see an email from Jackson.
- Open that email and click the button **Sign in**. Now you've successfully logged into the BoxyHQ Admin Portal.
- Click on the Audit Logs menu from the sidebar on the left to access the Retraced service.
