# Exposing Retraced Data


There are two main way to expose your audit log data to your application's users. Users can browse and search events using an embeddable viewer UI, or they can access data programmatically using API tokens. 

## Using the embedded viewer

As a vendor, you can [embed the event viewer](/docs/retraced/getting-started/embedded-viewer/) into frontend site. For a guide to viewer features, see [Using the Embedded Viewer](/docs/retraced/exposing-retraced-data/viewer/)

## Using Enterprise IT Integration API Tokens

In addition to the viewer, Audit events can be exposed via the [Enterprise IT Integration API](/docs/retraced/exposing-retraced-data/enterprise-api/)
