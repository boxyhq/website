# Self Hosting

Getting a production environment of Retraced up and running is probably one of the first things you want to do! This section goes through the different options available depending on where you'll be hosting Retraced.

Self-hosting Retraced means managing the service yourself and taking care of upgrades, scaling, security etc.

The docker container can be found at [retracedhq/retraced](https://hub.docker.com/r/retracedhq/retraced/tags). It is preferable to use a specific version instead of the `latest` tag.

## Deployment options

- [Docker](docker.md)
- [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.md)
- [AWS](aws.md)
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)
- [Skaffold](skaffold.md)
