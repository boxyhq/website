# Enterprise API

### [Swagger JSON](http://localhost:3000/auditlog/enterprise/v1/swagger.json) | [API Console](https://retraced.readme.io/v1.0/reference)

## Overview

The Enterprise API is the API that the end customer (the enterprise IT administrator) will consume to pull their organization events and ingest it into their own internal systems.

## Authentication

The Enterprise API endpoints expect the token to be provided in a header of the form

```
Authorization: token=YOUR_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN
```

## Getting an Enterprise API Token

There are currently two ways to manage Enterprise API tokens.

- Most often, end customers create and manage Enterprise IT tokens using the UI in the [Embedded Viewer](/docs/retraced/getting-started/embedded-viewer)
- There are also endpoints in the [Publisher API](/docs/retraced/apis/publisher-api) that
  allow a vendor to create, edit, and delete Enterprise API tokens

Note that to allow end customers to manage Enterprise API tokens in the embedded viewer,
the `is_admin` query parameter must be set to `true` when [requesting a token to initialize the embedded viewer](https://retraced.readme.io/reference#publisherv1projectprojectidviewertoken)
