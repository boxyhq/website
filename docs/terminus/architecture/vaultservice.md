# Vault Service

The vault service acts as the middleware between the Proxy Service and the Persistence Vault. Amongst it's roles and responsibilities:

- Supports multi-tenancy and multi-product logical segregation via API URL paths
- It exposes the low-level API for the Proxy to interface with the persistence vault
  - Read entries
  - Write entries
- Implements internal logical encryption between the proxy and the database treating data as blobs
- Implements Access Control Policies
- It is not business model aware

It is written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

---

## Interaction with the Persistence Vault

Leverages [GORM](https://gorm.io/) to interface with the database. Currently is configured to use PostgreSQL but supports any persistence store supported by GORM.

Implements AES encryption against the data store.

> :warning: **IMPORTANT**: changes on encryption keys of the logical encryption layer will render the data stored useless.

## Configuration

### Running via Docker Compose

When running on docker, all the environment variables are specified either as environment variables or in the `.env` file.

**When running via `docker compose` the below does not apply.**

### Default vs Runtime

The Vault Service ships with default configurations for the service components
.
The `default` configuration ships in the `./conf/default` directory and it is copied on startup on the `./conf/runtime` directory IF such directory is empty.

The `./conf/runtime` directory is where the actual configurations are read from.

The configuration files are as follows:

### vault_conf.cue

CUE lang based configuration file containing the necessary variables. These can be set both in this file or as ENVIRONMENT variables.
**If set as environment variables, those will take precedence over the ones defined in the configuration default/runtime files.**

### access.cue

Defines:

- The access control policies to the APIs via CUE lang definition. Multiple ACPs can be defined, but only the one assigned to the `defaultPolicy` will be used.

// The request is filled by the calling system
apiRequest: acp.#APIRequest & {}

// Sample policy
access: acp.#AuthResponse & {

 request: apiRequest
 for permission in defaultPolicy.apis[request.apiName].permissions {
  if list.Contains(apiKeysAndPermissions[request.access_token], permission) {
   allowed: true
  }
 }
}
```

**NOTES**:

- the paths in the API definitions are values accepted by Go's [Gorilla Mux's](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) specification.
- the names in the API definitions (i.e. `vaultStatus`) are mapped via code to the relevant handling functions.
- the `version` is used as part of the path. An example of the status endpoint served by a proxy running locally on port 3002 would be:
    [http://127.0.0.1:3002/v1/status](http://127.0.0.1:3002/v1/status)

- The API Keys and their role-based mapping

```
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// API Keys
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
apiKeysAndPermissions: acp.#AuthTokens & {
 readAPIKey1: [ "READ" ]
 writeAPIKey1: [ "WRITE" ]
 adminAPIKey1: [ "ADMIN" ]
 allAPIKey1: [ "READ", "WRITE", "ADMIN" ]
 readwriteAPIKey1: [  "READ","WRITE" ]
}
```

**NOTE**: this will be removed and implemented either as an external service or fully integrated in an OPA or similar access control framework. Currently duplicates the proxy service configuration
