# Observability

Jackson provides first-class observability on the back of OpenTelemetry. Currently we support the following metrics. Traces and logs are coming soon.

Please check the [Environment Variables](../jackson/deploy/env-variables#opentelemetry-configuration) to configure to enable this feature.
